Title: Launching Station of Commons

----

Description:

We are as pleased as excited to launch Station of Commons, our new online artist-run platform to broadcast, share and discuss Commoning practices within Open technology. Station of Commons is not an accomplished state of things but an always in the making process. Based on Open Source technology resources, we will develop the platform to offer more possibilities for everyone willing to communicate securely and continue to form their everyday life practice online.

N10, a new space dedicated to sound experiment in Helsinki, had to cancel the upcoming event on 20/03/2020 for obvious safety reasons. The space is now closed. However, we discussed between organizers and artists, and realized that our practices should not stop but continue by adapting to the situation. Station of Commons offers space to broadcast the event. Moreover, Station of Commons does not rely on social media streaming technology, away from FB, IG or others. We installed our server on the tiny computer RaspberryPi using Open source software.

The stream will start at 19:00 EEST the 03.04.2020

you are welcome to join the first audio streaming event by Station of Commons and N10!
