Station of Commons investigates the possibilities of technology and its reappro- piation within public space. The point of departure of the research questions both centralized knowledge and data centers operated by major organizations and its underlying social implications. What are the interdependences between the users, the providers, the services, the technology and related knowledge at work? And how to rethink another model of shared empowerment situated in time and space unique to its actor. A Station of Commons operates as easily integrable on-line platform for sharing local resources. Resources as commons integrate the ideas of shared data, open source practices, artefacts and real time broadcast. The sustainability of exchange, the ways they interoperate, the ecolo- gies of interaction between the Stations of Commons produce provocations for a better collective understanding on how the Commons are in constant flux and also at risk.

A Station of Commons connects and communicates with other Stations of Com- mons over Internet without its hegemonic agency. Internet infrastructure serves only as practical protocol of communication between stations and not a central- ized server concentrating and accumulating power. Each Station depends on its own means of production, way of thinking, learning and sharing. This position of autonomy reflects on the original concept of Internet: the equality in the relation client to server and the openness of the algorithmic process. The exhibition op- erates as a vibrant thinking space dedicated for workshops, performances and critical discussions around the practice of commoning and open technologies.
